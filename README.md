# CalcDrivingCalculator_Python

The "dist" folder contains the .exe file which can be run without Python or an IDE.

 Instructions:
  1. Download the "dist" folder.
  2. Add your text file to the "dist" folder. The text file must be formatted exactly the same as the example text file (filename "Speeds.txt").
  3. Run "Main.exe" and follow the instructions in the program. It will do all required calculations automatically.


 Note: the best way to get a text file that is usable with this program is to export an Excel file with the two columns of data (in the format time,speed) to a .csv, then open the .csv in Notepad, copy all the data (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C) then paste all the data in a new text file (create a text file, then Ctrl+V).
